BACKGROUND TASK OPTIMIZER - .INI CONFIGURATION GUIDE
====================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Configuration files define rules for automatically managing Windows processes. 
Each .ini file represents a mode (Gaming, Work, etc.) and must be placed in the "mode" folder.

BASIC STRUCTURE
---------------
[RULE1]
description = What this rule does
condition_task = process1.exe
terminate_task = process2.exe
mode = permanent

REQUIRED PARAMETERS
-------------------
SECTION NAME: [RULE#] where # is unique identifier
description: Human-readable description
condition_task: Process(es) that trigger the rule (comma-separated)
terminate_task: Process(es) to terminate when rule activates
mode: Currently only "permanent" supported

OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
-------------------
restart_task: Specific processes to restart (default: auto-restart terminated processes)
restart_delay: Seconds to wait before restarting (default: 0)
dynamic_restart: Auto-restart when condition becomes false (default: true)

HOW IT WORKS
------------
1. CONDITION ACTIVATION: Any process in condition_task runs → Rule activates
2. TERMINATION: All processes in terminate_task are killed
3. DEACTIVATION: All condition_task processes stop → Rule deactivates
4. RESTART: After delay, processes are automatically restarted

FINDING PROCESS NAMES
---------------------
To identify the correct process name for any task:
1. Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
2. Right-click on the process
3. Select "Properties"
4. The actual executable name appears in the properties window
Example: "Gaming Services" task uses "gameservices.exe"

COMPLETE EXAMPLES
-----------------
[RULE_GAMING]
description = Optimize system for gaming
condition_task = game.exe
terminate_task = onedrive.exe,spotify.exe
restart_delay = 3

[RULE_WORK]
description = Block distractions during work
condition_task = excel.exe,winword.exe
terminate_task = steam.exe,discord.exe
dynamic_restart = true

BEST PRACTICES
--------------
- Always include .exe extension
- Use comma-separated lists for multiple processes
- Test rules incrementally
- Use descriptive rule names like [RULE_GAMING]
- Verify process names in Task Manager Properties

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Process won't terminate: Check exact name in Task Manager Properties
Rule not activating: Verify condition_task spelling and .exe extension
Process won't restart: Some applications require admin rights or specific paths
